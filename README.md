This is a classic memory skill game. You have to keep track of old pattern with the new upcoming patterns.

#How to play?

If the game shows R color press R then the game shows Y color then for correct answer press R then Y and so on..
In short you have to memorize all colors from the start and any new color added, you will have to start clicking pattern all the way from the start to the new color added to the pattern.

So whats the wait guys? Your bain is hungry :P Start feeding it... LETS PLAY......
